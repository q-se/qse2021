                        <span class='underline-blue'> Quantum computers</span> promise to solve unthinkably complex problems that traditional computers could ever solve.The evidence of such quantum supremacy over traditional computers has started to emerge as it can be seen by Google’s quantum computer recently performing a complex computation that would take 10,000 years for the best supercomputer available today. High-level languages to write quantum programs have also started to appear, e.g., Microsoft’s Q# and IBM’s Qiskit. Thus, we believe that this is the right time to build a community for quantum software engineering (QSE) focusing on devising methods, approaches, and processes to develop software for quantum programs efficiently and to ensure their correctness. The Q-SE workshop will provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss the challenges in developing software quantum software in high-level quantum languages, developing novel solutions to build correct methods for developing testing quantum programs, executing quantum software, developing best practices, and creating a research roadmap of quantum software engineering.

                    The key goals of the workshop are: 1) Provide practical and generalizable insights on how to apply and extend existing approaches to quantum software development or develop entirely new approaches, 2) Devise ways in which industry and academia can collaborate to provide further knowledge on developing quantum software, 3) Provide academia with feedback on which skills and abilities are required in quantum software development and where to concentrate on the education of students, 4) Demonstrate to academia new as well as existing practical challenges in the field of quantum software engineering, 5) Communicate the latest research findings to practitioners and discuss ways to adopt them for industrial products, services, and processes.

	   <br> <b>Keynote 1: Learning to measure: a new approach to variational quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers by Sabrina Maniscalco, University of Helsinki, and Aalto University</b></by>	
	   <br> <b> Abstract: </b>  Variational quantum algorithms stand as the most promising approaches towards practical applications of near-term quantum computers [1,2]. However, these methodologies usually require a large number of measurements, which represents an important roadblock for future real-world applications. We introduce a novel approach to tackle this problem: a variational measurement scheme. We present an algorithm that optimises informationally complete POVMs on-the-fly in order to minimise the statistical fluctuations in the estimation of relevant cost functions. We use it in combination with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver to calculate ground-state energies of molecular Hamiltonians and show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art measurement reduction approaches. Our computational experiments further suggest a measurement scaling exponent below 2. We also highlight the potential of the informational completeness of the measurement outcomes by reusing the ground-state energy estimation data to perform reduced state tomography with high fidelity on the XX model spin chain [3].</br>

She is the Vice Director of the Finnish Centre of Excellence for Quantum Technologies & serves on advisory and scientific boards of several institutions. Sabrina obtained her PhD at the University of Palermo (Italy) in 2004 and has held academic research positions around the world, in Sofia (Bulgaria), Durban (South Africa), Turku (Finland) and Edinburgh (UK). She returned to Finland in 2014 to lead the Theoretical Physics Laboratory in Turku.

Sabrina has coordinated several international and interdisciplinary projects, and is recognised as one of the leading experts in Quantum Technologies. She loves inventing novel approaches to doing research, learning, and innovating, and believes in the power of "engineering synchronicity" and in the joys of good food, sauna, road-trips, and outdoor living and interestingly she is also an entrepreneur; as the CEO of Algorithmiq Oy, she is pioneering quantum algorithms to tackle complex problems in life sciences. Her passion for outreach led her to co-create QPlayLearn, www.qplaylearn.com, an online platform to teach quantum science and technologies to everyone.</b> </br> 	
	
	<br> <b>Keynote 2:  Verification of Quantum Programs by Mingsheng Ying,  University of Technology Sydney, Australia </b> </br>
	<br> <b> Abstract: </b> In this talk, I'll mainly discuss the program logic approach to verification of quantum programs, including quantum Hoare logic, invariant generation and termination analysis for quantum programs. I'll also briefly discuss potential applications of model checking for verification and debugging of quantum programs. Some problems for future research will be proposed at the end of the paper.  </br>
